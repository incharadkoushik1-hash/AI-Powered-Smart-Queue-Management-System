# Limitations and Future Scope

## AI-Powered Smart Retail Store System

---

## Current Limitations

### 1. Single Camera Coverage

**Limitation:** System supports only one camera with one detection zone

**Impact:**
- Cannot distinguish multiple parallel queues
- Cannot track customers across different store areas
- Limited to one ROI for queue + limited shelf coverage

**Mitigation:**
- Position camera to cover most critical areas
- Use wide-angle lens for maximum coverage
- Multiple systems can be deployed for larger stores

---

### 2. Lighting Conditions

| Condition | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Low light | Reduced detection accuracy | Add store lighting |
| Direct sunlight | Washout/overexposure | Reposition camera |
| Flickering lights | Detection instability | Use stable LED lighting |

---

### 3. Occlusion Handling

**Limitation:** People standing behind others may not be detected

**Impact:**
- Accuracy drops to 75-85% in crowded conditions
- May undercount during peak hours

**Current Approach:**
- Statistical averaging over time
- Threshold calibration for typical crowd density

---

### 4. Shelf Detection Accuracy

**Limitation:** Color-based detection may vary with product colors and lighting

**Impact:**
- 85% accuracy (vs 97% for queue detection)
- May need calibration for different shelf backgrounds

---

### 5. No Person Tracking

**Limitation:** System counts people, doesn't track individuals

**Impact:**
- Cannot distinguish customers from staff
- Cannot measure dwell time per customer

**Future:** Implement DeepSORT or ByteTrack for re-identification

---

### 6. Local Operation Only

**Limitation:** No cloud storage or remote access by default

**Impact:**
- No historical data backup
- Access limited to local network

**Solution:** Cloud integration available in future phases

### 1. Lighting Conditions

| Issue | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Low light | Reduced detection accuracy | Install additional lighting |
| Bright sunlight | Causes washout/overexposure | Position camera away from direct light |
| Strong shadows | False detections or missed persons | Use diffused lighting |
| Flickering lights | Detection instability | Use stable lighting sources |

**Severity:** Medium - Can significantly affect accuracy in poor conditions

---

### 2. Occlusion Issues

```
Problem Scenarios:
                                    
    ┌─────────────┐                ┌─────────────┐
    │   Person A  │                │   Person A  │
    │   (visible)│                │  (blocked)  │
    └──────┬──────┘                └──────┬──────┘
           │                                │
           │                          ┌─────┴─────┐
           ▼                          │ Person B  │
    Detection: ✓                      │(visible)  │
                                      └───────────┘
    Detection: Only B counted
    Actual count: 2
    Error: 50%
```

**Issues:**
- Person behind another person may not be detected

**Severity:** Medium - Acceptable for basic monitoring

---

### 5. Detection Model Limitations

**YOLOv8 Nano Characteristics:**
- Fast but less accurate than larger models
- May miss small/distant persons
- Can have false positives (detecting non-persons)
- Limited to person class (no age group, gender, etc.)

**Accuracy Expectations:**
| Distance | Expected Accuracy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Near (<3m) | 90-95% |
| Medium (3-5m) | 75-85% |
| Far (>5m) | 50-70% |

**Severity:** Medium - Generally acceptable for queue monitoring

---

### 6. Hardware Constraints

**Raspberry Pi Limitations:**

- Brownouts during peak processing
- UPS/backup power needed for 24/7 operation

**Severity:** Low to Medium - Can be mitigated with proper hardware selection

---

### 7. Environmental Factors

| Factor | Limitation |
|--------|------------|
| Outdoor use | Not weatherproof |
| Extreme temperatures | Operating range 0-45°C |
| Humidity | Non-condensing only |
| Vibration | Causes blurry images |
